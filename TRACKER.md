## Outstanding gaps from critic agents

| # | Gap | Severity | Owner / next action |
|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | Extension `<all_urls>` permission overreach | 🟡 medium | Narrow to specific retailer + AI-chat host patterns in next cycle |
| G2 | Privacy notice / consent modal absent | 🟡 medium | Ship `/privacy` page + first-run consent dialog |
| G3 | Cloudflare Worker logs request bodies (Tier 0 promise broken) | 🟡 medium | Strip request bodies from console.log, document log retention |
| G4 | Fan-out to 3rd-party AIs (OpenAI/Google/OpenRouter) undisclosed in UI | 🟡 medium | Update cross-model card subtitle to name providers |
| G5 | Vision uploads pass through 2 third parties (CF + Anthropic) without disclosure | 🟡 medium | Add upload-confirmation modal |
| G6 | DELIVERY_ARCHITECTURE promises k-anonymity, encryption-at-rest — none implemented | 🟡 medium | Walk back doc claims OR build D1 + encryption layer |
| G7 | Wine pack still has one-source (Nature) overloaded citation | 🟢 low | Add second source |
| G8 | All packs share `lastVerified: 2026-04-21` — bulk-generation tell | 🟢 low | Spread dates as enricher updates packs |
| G9 | `lookupSpec` could false-positive on string fields | 🟢 low | Prioritize numeric-yielding fields in alias resolution |
| G10 | No unit/integration tests | 🟡 medium | Add at least one end-to-end test against fixture mode |
| G11 | Per-criterion candidate scores opaque (where did 0.73 come from?) | 🟢 low | Add tooltip linking score to spec value |
| G12 | Each category pack only has 5-7 criteria; real categories have 20-50 specs | 🟡 medium | Expand category packs with `secondaryCriteria[]` array (next cycle, per user note) |
| G13 | No SKU catalog — every audit relies on live web search or hand-curated fixture | ✅ shipped | `representativeSkus[]` field added to CategoryBody. Espresso/laptops/headphones packs have 7-8 SKUs each. `search.ts` fixture mode now pulls from pack SKUs with legacy fallback. |

## Next loop priorities

1. Expand 5 category packs with `secondaryCriteria` (15-25 additional specs per pack) — addresses G12, user's "many specs exist" observation
2. Privacy notice + consent modal (G2)
3. Disclose 3rd-party fan-out in UI (G4, G5)
4. Add at least one end-to-end pipeline test (G10)
5. Strengthen wine pack with second source (G7)

## Cycle log

- Cycle N (2026-04-21): all 85 packs validated 0-warning; primary source on every pack; pack-maintenance cron with 4 jobs live; passive-scan endpoint shipped; pipeline warnings added; extension build script added; profile export/import; verdict banner counts unverifiable.
